        <p class="important-text" id="html-and-css">Today I'm learning about how to properly style html text while using the 'style' tag. I learned how to manipulate the fonts and I'm going to try practising those skill on this 'blog' page. From what I can tell, it would be faster to set up simple parameters first, before spending all my time styling everything. The headings and the simple rules can be done before I do anything more advanced.</p>

        <p class="important-text" id="plans-future">I want to learn a few different starting programming languages just as the programming YouTubers said. I really just want to learn as much as I can and do the training so I can eventually know enough to figure if being a coder is the job fo me</p>
        
        <h3 id="javascript">Javascript</h3>
        <h6>Posted on 24.04.2022 (obviously)</h6>
        
        <p class="important-text">I don't know much about this language, but I have 2 books on the subject and from what I can tell during the Khan academy tutorial, I like the feel of it.</p>
        <h3 id="python">Python</h3>
        <h6>Posted on 24.04.2022 (I'm writing this in one go)</h6>
        
        <p class="important-text">I've heard this is the simplest language. I've also heard it's widely used. I wonder about that, but I don't mind taking the detour. I have plenty of time to learn about all of them.</p>

        <h6>Posted on 24.04.2022 (as I said...)</h6>
        
        <p class="important-text" id="becoming-programmer">I'm currently a history teacher, who is also studying to become a philosophy Major in college. However, I realized this wasn't exactly my nature. I need to prioritize myself above what I perceive I owe to students in my school. Those things will fade. 5 years are enough. I think it all would be enough at that point for me to quit. I want to become a programmer and earn a lot of money. It's simple like that.</p>
